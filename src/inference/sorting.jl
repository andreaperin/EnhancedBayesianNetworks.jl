    fill_score(ig, ns, node)

Elimination-ordering heuristic (min-fill flavour): scores a node by the ratio of fill-in edges its
elimination would *add* to the edges it would *remove* (`0.0` when it has no neighbours). Lower scores
are eliminated earlier. Pass as the `scorefun` argument to [`infer`](@ref).

# Examples
```julia
W = DiscreteNode(:W); W[:W => :sunny] = 0.5; W[:W => :cloudy] = 0.5
S = DiscreteNode(:S, [:W])
S[:W => :sunny, :S => :on] = 0.9; S[:W => :sunny, :S => :off] = 0.1
S[:W => :cloudy, :S => :on] = 0.2; S[:W => :cloudy, :S => :off] = 0.8
bn = BayesianNetwork([W, S]); add_child!(bn, :W, :S); order!(bn)

infer(bn, :S, Evidence(:W => :sunny), fill_score)
```

    factor_score(ig, ns, node)

Elimination-ordering heuristic (min-factor flavour): scores a node by the size of the factor its
elimination would create — the product of the state-space sizes of the node and its current neighbours.
Lower scores are eliminated earlier. Pass as the `scorefun` argument to [`infer`](@ref).

# Examples

"""
    fill_factor_score(ig, ns, node)

Default elimination-ordering heuristic for [`infer`](@ref): a tuple `(fill_score, factor_score, node)`
compared lexicographically — break [`fill_score`](@ref) ties by the smaller resulting factor
([`factor_score`](@ref)), then by node id for determinism. Lower is eliminated earlier.
